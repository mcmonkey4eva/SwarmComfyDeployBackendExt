# Swarm ComfyDeploy Backend Extension

An extension for [SwarmUI](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI) to use [ComfyDeploy](https://www.comfydeploy.com/) as a backend.

This requires you have a valid ComfyDeploy account with API authorization token, a valid machine with machine_id to use, and a workflow registered to take a dynamic workflow as `workflow_api` input, and models on the server that match your local models.

This is an initial/experimental implementation.
